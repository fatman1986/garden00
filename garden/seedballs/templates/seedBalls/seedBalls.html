<h3 style="font-family:Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color:#009966;">Seed balls are handmade compressed balls of seed, compost, clay, and water. They are portable habitats awaiting rain to stimulate growth and have been used worldwide to establish and restore habitats.</h3>
<h3 style="font-family:Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color:#009966;">Seed balls may have special themes depending upon the seeds used. Imagine creating a native wildflower meadow on the schoolyard with seed balls.  Or, surprise mother on her special day with a box of seed balls containing her favorite herb or perennial seeds.</h3>
